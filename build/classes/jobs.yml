# ---------
# Jobs must follow the following format:
#  jobs:
#    EXAMPLE:                                                        <- Job name MUST be UPPERCASE
#      maxplayers: 0                                 <- Maximum # of players who can have this job
#      break:                                       <- Blocks listed below will payout when broken
#        <blockID>: <value>         <- <blockID>=ID of block broken , <value>=Amount to be paid
#      place:                                       <- Blocks listed below will payout when placed

#        <fishName>: <value>          <- <fishName>=Can be found below , <value>=Amount to be paid
#      tools:                                <- Tools listed will multiply payout values when used
#        <toolID>: <multiplierValue>        <- I think I've told you this enough times already.
#      craft:                                       <- Items listed below will payout when created
#        <itemID>: <value>                                     <- <itemID> = ID of item CREATED
#      brew:                    <- Items listed below will payout when consumed in a brewing stand
#        <itemID>: <value>                               <- <itemID> = ID of brewing ingredient
#      smelt:                                          <- Items blahblah when smelted with furnace
#        <itemID>: <value>                        <- <itemID> = ID of item you put INTO furnace
#      enchant:             <- Enchanting pays by the level, so it's easier than the rest of these
#        active: <true|false>               <- Whether or not this job counts as an enchanting job
#        payPerLevel: <value>                                  <- Amount to pay per expended level
#      worlds:                  <- Players will only be paid if they're in one of the worlds below
#      - <worldname>                                               <- <worldname>= name of a world
# NOTE: Jobnames and Items (ID_xx, MOBTYPE) MUST BE UPPERCASE. Everything else is lowercase. No
#   exceptions. Failure to follow this will result in the plugin failing.
# SECOND NOTE: You also need to have ALL of the fields listed. Failure will blahblahblah. I 
#   already said that.
