{"name":"Minejobs","tagline":"","body":"###Welcome to the MineJobs Homepage!\r\nYes, that's right, I shamelessly used a website generator instead of making the page myself as I usually prefer to do. Oh well. I'll deal with that later. On to business.\r\n\r\nThis is where I'll be posting information about MineJobs most frequently. Important updates, upcoming features, etc. I probably won't post things often, but this will be the most frequent place I do post information.\r\n\r\nBy the way, don't use the buttons on the side there to download the project. They'll download the source files for the entire NetBeans project. If you're looking for a download, head over to [the BukkitDev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/MineJobs), or if you really must have one here, you can nab the latest build out of [the dist folder](https://github.com/eNnillaMS/MineJobs/tree/master/dist).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
